//        Generating HasCode in java as string is a non primitive data type means it having class and object that means in this java inbuilt hash function can work but as integer that is not have any class or object and also it is a primitive data type that's why it can't be generate hashcode via inbuilt function but we can do it by using Integer wrapper class now it can generate a hashcode from it and as number's ascii value is also number so no change in the hashcode
//        String s1= "code";
//        int hash= s1.hashCode(); // it return in integer
//        System.out.println(hash);

//        String s2 = "Code"; // it changes as casse sensitive
//        System.out.println(s2.hashCode()); // this is inbuilt method  hashcode craete by ascii value multiply by 31 and then add and return

//        int a =123;
//        System.out.println(a.hashCode());

//        Integer b = 123;   // Integer wrapper class
//        System.out.println(b.hashCode());
